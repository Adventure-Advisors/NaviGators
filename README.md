# NaviGators
## Problem
Planning a road trip/long travel is an arduous process with many important variables in the mix. Finding the best route, lodging, and food, all while maintaining safety, cost-awareness, and a good time is no small task! 

## Solution 

- NaviGator is a trip planning application that assists users in planning long travels by breaking down the journey based on their preferences. 

## Features

- Allows users to input their travel destination, start location, and key preferences such as preferred hotels (price range for hotels), food choices, and driving durations. 

- Provides users with hotel recommendations along the route, based on their preferences and budget constraints. 

- Calculates and display estimated driving durations between locations, considering traffic conditions and user preferences for driving time per day. 

- Suggest activities or things to do around stops areas 

- Generate a detailed itinerary for the trip, including recommended hotels, food stops, and suggested durations for each leg of the journey.
